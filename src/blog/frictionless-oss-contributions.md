Contributing to Open-source can be intimidating as you have to spent a lot of time while going through long README files to find out How to do the development setup that is essential for getting started. This is a serious barrier for contributors. It can be a huge pain especially if you're some one who is just starting out. Every day developers waste millions of hours and energy switching contexts between projects and branches, setting up development environments, or simply waiting for builds to complete when all the want is to start coding.

Let's say you want to contribute to  [Carbon](https://carbon.now.sh/)( A JS app that lets you create and share beautiful images of your source code ). Before you can make your contribution you have to make sure that you have done everything from step 1 to 4 as shown below in the screenshot from the [Contribution Guide of Carbon](https://github.com/carbon-app/carbon/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md).

![Contributions Step](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/46004116/66287768-66713100-e8f0-11e9-9bb9-b712236059d0.png)

Before step 2 you have to make sure that you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed and then you have to continue with the rest of the steps. Now the setup for Carbon is not that complex but it can be intimidating and frustrating for beginners and it still requires time and energy to be spent on the what thats not even the part of the contribution.

The setup for Carbon is not that complex but mostly for popular and valueable Open-source projects that is not the case i.e most of them have complex development environments( i.e they include modern build pipelines  + test suites + linters and things like that and so on and so forth ). Configuring and setting up all this stuff can be cryptic, hard and can take a lot of time and effort.

What if somehow something can save us from spending our time and energy from configuring and setting up all these cryptic and repetitive developement setups. What if something can automate all of this with a single click so that we can focus and spent more time on our goal which is contributing to Open-source while forgetting about the developement enviroment. Well! Gitpod is here to help.
