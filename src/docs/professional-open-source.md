# Professional Open Source

It wouldn't have been possible for us to create Gitpod without all the amazing open-source work it's built upon. And still, we're developing huge parts of Gitpod in open source. 

Deeply devoted to the open source community, we are happy to provide professional open-source contributors a free **Professional Open Source** plan.

## What does it include?
No more hour restrictions, use Gitpod for unlimited hours on any public GitHub or GitLab repository.

## Who is eligible?

You should meet **at least one** of the following requirements:
1. You are a maintainer, or core contributor, of a well-established open source project
2. A significant part of your income is from open source work (e.g. via Liberapay, Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, etc)
3. You regularly contribute to open source in other ways (e.g. producing regular content like blog posts, videos, live streams, or organizing meet-ups, conferences, hackathons, etc)

Does at least one of the above apply to your work? Then please [get in touch](/contact/) and provide links to your projects. We'd love to see what you're working on. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
