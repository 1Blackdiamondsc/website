# Gitpod Self-Hosted

Gitpod, just as you know it from gitpod.io, can be installed and operated on your own infrastructure.
This infrastructure may be a cloud provider or self-managed kubernetes.
It may be on the public internet, behind a corporate firewall, or on a network without internet access.
Gitpod self-hosted is free to use for up to three simultaneous users.
