# Julia in Gitpod

## Examples

A minimal example of a ready-to-code Julia development environment is [JesterOrNot/Gitpod-Julia](https://github.com/JesterOrNot/Gitpod-Julia). Feel free to take a look.

And to showcase a real-world Julia project in Gitpod, we've gitpodified the [Julia repository](https://github.com/JesterOrNot/Julia) itself! Try it here:
