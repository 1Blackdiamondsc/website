# Unlimited Open Source

It'd not have been possible for us to create Gitpod without all the amazing open-source work, it's built upon. And still, we're developing huge parts of Gitpod in open source. 

Deeply devoted to the open source community, we are happy to provide professional open-source contributors a free **Unlimited Open Source** plan. 

##What does it include?
No more hour restrictions, use Gitpod for unlimited hours on any public GitHub or GitLab repository.

##Who is eligible? 

You should meet at least one of the following requirements:
1. You are a maintainer, or core contributor, of a well-established open source project
2. A significant part of your revenue comes from open source work (e.g. via Liberapay, Open Collective, GitHub Sponsors, Patreon, etc)
3. You regularly contribute to open source in other ways (e.g. producing content like blog posts, videos, live streams, or organizing conferences, meet-ups, hackathons)

Is at least one criterion applying to your work? Please, [get in contact](/contact/) and send us a link to your projects. We'd love to see what you're working on. 

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions.
